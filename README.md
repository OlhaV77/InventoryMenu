# InventoryMenu
his is a git repository we will be using to keep track of our code.

Phase 1:

Create a menu with options:

1. Add an item
2. Display all items
3. Quit

An item contains name & price.

When adding an item, ask for a name and price of the item.
Example:
Name: Apple
Price ($): 0.99

When displaying all items, display item name and price. Example: Apple - $0.99


Commit and push all the code to the above repository.
